SCRAPER ENGINE FIXES (v2.0 LOCKED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[BUG FIX] Host vs Reviewer Bug
  - Fixed the scraper picking reviewer profiles instead of the host.
  - Now uses PdpHomeMarketplace marker in the URL — only the host has it.

[BUG FIX] Login Redirect Bug
  - /users/show/ was redirecting to Airbnb's login page.
  - Switched to /users/profile/ which works without authentication.

[BUG FIX] Host Section Not Found
  - Old pdp-host-profile-section selector didn't work.
  - Added multi-selector fallback (HOST_OVERVIEW_DEFAULT, HOST_PROFILE_DEFAULT)
    plus text-based fallback searching for "anfitrião"/"superhost" in Portuguese.

[BUG FIX] "Consultar Perfil" as Host Name
  - The h2/h3 element was grabbing a button label instead of actual name.
  - Rewrote extraction to use regex on section text (Anfitriã(o): {name}),
    with a blacklist filter for garbage values.

[FEATURE] Portuguese Language Support
  - Added PT-BR variants for Superhost (superanfitrião, superanfitriã),
    host name patterns (Anfitriã(o), Hospede-se com), and listing counts
    (anúncios, acomodações).

[REMOVED] AI Dependency
  - Completely removed all AI/Gemini dependencies.
  - Status flow simplified: pending → ready. Zero quota issues.


APP UI CHANGES (v2.0.1 through v2.0.7)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[v2.0.1] Compact Portfolio Display
  - Replaced 41 rows of "Listing" with a single clean card:
    "41 imóveis gerenciados".

[v2.0.2] Clean Portfolio Display
  - Removed confusing "X imóveis detectados no perfil" subtitle.
  - Just shows the total number now.

[v2.0.3] CRM-Style Display
  - Host name is now the primary lead identifier (was listing title).
  - Listing title appears as subtitle in the detail sheet.

[v2.0.4] Missing Leads Fix + Search by Host Name
  - Fixed: contatado == false excluded null rows (changed to != true).
  - Search bar now matches host name, listing title, and neighborhood.

[v2.0.5] Host Name Extraction Fix + Total Leads Count
  - Fixed "Consultar Perfil" appearing as host name for all leads.
  - Total Leads now shows real DB count (allLeads), not filtered count.

[v2.0.6] Default Sort = Luxury Score
  - App opens sorted by highest Luxury Score instead of newest.

[v2.0.7] Real Contact Actions
  - Removed fake WhatsApp/Email buttons. Replaced with:
    * "Mensagem no Airbnb" → Opens listing page to DM the host
    * "Pesquisar Contato" → Google searches "{host name} {bairro} contato telefone"
    * WhatsApp/Email only appear when real data exists in DB

[v2.0.8] Host Categorization (Company vs Person)
  - Added smart detection for professional hosts vs individuals.
  - Logic: Name keywords (Stay, Luxury, Aluguel) + Portfolio Size (>2) + Word Count.
  - Tags are stored in the 'badges' column for easy visibility in the CRM.
  - All 94 existing leads have been bulk-categorized.
  - No 5G connection required for this approach.

NEXT STEPS (CRM EVOLUTION)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Lead Deduplication by Host

     - Follow-up reminders / timestamps

  3. Lead Scoring Improvement
     - Factor in portfolio size (bigger host = bigger deal)
     - Factor in Superhost status
     - Factor in maintenance items (more = more opportunities)

   4. Host-Centric View
      - Tap a host → see ALL their listings in one place

   5. Pipeline/Funnel View
     - Visual funnel: New → Contacted → Responded → Closed
